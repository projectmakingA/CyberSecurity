PORT SCANNER 
1)Enhanced Detection of Open Ports 
Problem Statement: Port scanners to detect open ports on networks with advanced security  
measures such as firewalls and IDS/IPS systems. This limitation can result in incomplete network  
assessments. 
Requirements: 
• Develop the scanner in Python using libraries like socket and termcolor. 
• Implement advanced scanning techniques (e.g., SYN scan, FIN scan) to evade basic  
firewalls and IDS. 
• Include configuration options for customizing scan methods and parameters. 
Objective: Create a Python-based port scanner that enhances open port detection by using  
advanced scanning techniques and customizable parameters to improve network assessment  
accuracy.  
Things We Learn: 
• Advanced scanning techniques and their effectiveness against different network defenses. 
• Implementation of Python networking libraries and their capabilities. 
• Techniques for configuring and customizing network scans to bypass security mechanisms.
